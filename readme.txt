You need to have python installed.
Moving this folder after setting up may result in the need to set up again
(because python bakes some paths into the virtual environment)

This uses a venv so you can just delete it afterward and don't need to install any packages.

EDIT: this is a work-in-progress. I'm getting familiar with the engine, making the UI elements (I'm going to have to make some custom buttons and stuff) and brainstorming how I want to structure things.
I make no promises.

I'm doing this largely because of how much I like the original flash game and wish it could be edited. I want to make my own classes and abilities! Add a new map or venue!
